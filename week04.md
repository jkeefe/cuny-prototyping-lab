**APIs & SDKs**

I like to call API's "Another Person's Information" -- services out there you can use to build a unique offering of your own. SDKs are "Software Development Kits" that let you tinker with real-world objects like the iPhone and Amazon Echo. We'll get our hands into some code today.

_Assignent due next week:_
* Find 10 APIs that might be useful to your project. Give me the title, the URL and how you might use it. 
* Install Eagle on your computer from   http://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview

## Plan

### API overview

### Dig into some APIs


    - Examine the Twitter API
    - The wonder of libraries
    - Demo the Twitter library
    - Demo mailgun
    
### Your own computer in the cloud

    - Build a computer in the cloud
    - Tweet from there
    - A hint at lambda
    

  
## I like, I wish, What if?
