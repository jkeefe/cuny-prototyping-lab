# Syllabus

Basic components of this class.

## Schedule

The schedule for this class is [here](SCHEDULE.md). Please note there is no class President's Day week (even though your other Monday classes will meet on Wednesday that week) and that one week we meet on Thursday (April 20) instead of Monday.

## Logistics

### Computers in Class

Bring them! You'll use your computer in every class.

Be here now. Please don't email, tweet, chat or communicate with people outside the class while we're having class. Your participation with other classmates is key. If you must take a call or a text for an urgent issue, please step out of the room.

### Slack for Communications

Let's strive for a no-email class. We'll communicate using Slack, like just about every newsroom in the United States. 

Slack is also a great platform for experimentation and prototyping, and we'll be doing some of that, too.

Our Slack is [cunylab.slack.com](https://cunylab.slack.com)

### Github for Code

I'll post code, examples and and class documents on Github. If you have a Github account, great. If not, don't worry. You don't need it right away, as the GitHub info is public.

Our Github is [github.com/jkeefe/cuny-prototyping-lab](https://github.com/jkeefe/cuny-prototyping-lab)

### Google Drive for Storage

We'll also keep a Google Drive folder for easy access to shared files. We'll make sure everyone has access to that folder on the first day of class.

## Assignments

Each week's assignment is due into the `Assignments Drop` Google Drive folder before the start of the next week's class. Late assignments will lose a full point.

Name your assignment files with the week it was assigned and your last name. So I would label the first assignment: `week01-keefe` If the assignment consists of multiple files, put them in a folder and name it the same way.

Each one should be like a blog post. Put some effort into it! Use this to lay the ground work for your final presentation.

Feedback on each assignment will be provided every week via Slack.

## Grading

There are 100 points possible in this class.

* **Attendance:** 30 points possible, 2 points for each class attended. 
* **Assignments:** 30 points possible, 1-2 points for awarded for each assignment completed. Incomplete or low-effort submissions will get a 1. Assignments not turned in by the start of the class for which they were assigned will lose one point.
* **Participation & Progress:** 30 points possible, 2 each week. This will be scored based on your active participation in class and your active progress on your projects. Note that absences will naturally cut into your participation score.
* **Final presentation:** 10 points possible, based on the criteria set out in the syllabus.
