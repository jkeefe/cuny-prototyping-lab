# Syllabus

Welcome to the prototyping lab! 

## Class Description

How to get journalism to audiences has been a challenge for decades. And with the unconventional campaign and subsequent election of Donald Trump for president, that's become an even bigger question for news organizations. Come explore what's next in news delivery and prototype your ideas. Throughout the industry, we see that the ability to build journalistic products is key, not just in startups from Vox to Quartz but also in big media companies of all sorts, from The New York Times to CNN to WNYC to a metro newspaper. This class will help you imagine and prototype new products and services -- and in the process reimagine journalism itself and how it connects with and serves the public. 

We'll develop and test your ideas using methods from paper prototyping and the latest technologies. We'll quickly see what works and what doesn't. We'll experiment with telling news stories through channels such as instant messaging, watches, intelligent agents like Siri and Alexa and even household objects. You will learn essential skills to develop, grow, test and retry how you tell stories -- and may even start a viable product. 

This laboratory is great for anyone who wants to have an edge in the changing media landscape, gain confidence in technology, learn a little code, explore ideas of their own or actually change how we consume journalism. Students will get hands-on experience with several initial prototypes and then pursue a larger project in pairs or small teams. No prior technical or coding experience required, though such skills will be helpful and welcome.

## Spirit

We're going to learn how to play, experiment, learn and tinker -- all with the goal of making new ways to experience and consume information. This is a hands-on class, and participation is key. Let's have some fun and make great things.

## Schedule

The schedule for this class is [here](SCHEDULE.md). Please note there is no class President's Day week (even though your other Monday classes will meet on Wednesday that week) and that one week we meet on Thursday (April 20) instead of Monday.

## Logistics

### Computers in Class

Bring them! You'll use your computer in every class.

Be here now. Please don't email, tweet, chat or communicate with people outside the class while we're having class. Your participation with other classmates is key. If you must take a call or a text for an urgent issue, please step out of the room.

### Slack for Communications

Let's strive for a no-email class. We'll communicate using Slack, like just about every newsroom in the United States. 

Slack is also a great platform for experimentation and prototyping, and we'll be doing some of that, too.

Our Slack is [cunylab.slack.com](https://cunylab.slack.com)

### Github for Code

I'll post code, examples and and class documents on Github. If you have a Github account, great. If not, don't worry. You don't need it right away, as the GitHub info is public.

Our Github is [github.com/jkeefe/cuny-prototyping-lab](https://github.com/jkeefe/cuny-prototyping-lab)

### Google Drive for Storage

We'll also keep a Google Drive folder for easy access to shared files. We'll make sure everyone has access to that folder on the first day of class.

## Assignments

Each week's assignment is due into the `Assignments Drop` Google Drive folder before the start of the next week's class. Late assignments will lose a full point.

Name your assignment files with the week it was assigned and your last name. So I would label the first assignment: `week01-keefe` If the assignment consists of multiple files, put them in a folder and name it the same way.

Each one should be like a blog post. Put some effort into it! Use this to lay the ground work for your final presentation.

Feedback on each assignment will be provided every week via Slack.

## Grading

There are 100 points possible in this class.

* **Attendance:** 30 points possible, 2 points for each class attended. 
* **Assignments:** 30 points possible, 1-2 points for awarded for each assignment completed. Incomplete or low-effort submissions will get a 1. Assignments not turned in by the start of the class for which they were assigned will lose one point.
* **Participation & Progress:** 30 points possible, 2 each week. This will be scored based on your active participation in class and your active progress on your projects. Note that absences will naturally cut into your participation score.
* **Final presentation:** 10 points possible, based on the criteria set out in the syllabus.

| Points | Grade |
| ------ | ----- |
| 97-100 |  A+ |
| 93-96 | A |
| 90-92 | A- |
| 87-89 | B+ |
| 83-86 | B |
| 80-82 | B- |
| 77-79 | C+ |
| 73-76 | C |
| 70-72 | C- |
| < 70 | F |

## Plagiarism

This is a journalism class; facts and honesty are our greatest asset. Presenting the work of others as your own is wrong and won't be tolerated. Doing so may result in a significant reduction of accumulated points and possible failure of the class.

When using code or ideas from other sources -- even free, open-sourced code -- be sure to include references and links back to that code and any applicable licenses.

If you are inspired by others, note it. It's just right.

And when working on teams, you may be asked to honestly note the specific and/or relative contributions of each teammate.
