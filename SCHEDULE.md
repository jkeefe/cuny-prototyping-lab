# Class Schedule

[-> Plans and notes](week01)

## Week 2 • Bots & Intelligent Agents 

Wednesday, February 7, 2018

Alexa, Siri and many other agents are now a part of our world. Let's play with some bots, build some bots, and think about how they could be used in your projects.

## Week 3 • APIs

Wednesday, February 14, 2018

Last day to drop this course is this coming Friday. 

I like to call API's "Another Person's Information" -- services out there you can use to build a unique offering of your own. We'll get our hands into some of this data and how we can play with it -- in our bots and on free online services.

## Week 4 • Making your own API

Wednesday, February 21, 2018

What if there's not an API out there that does _exactly_ what you want? You can make your own. This also happens to be how you can do calculations while you're computer -- and you -- are asleep. We'll get up and running with building things in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) "cloud."

## Week 5 • Cloud Computing Continued

Wednesday, February 28, 2018

There's a lot more we can do super cheaply with Amazon's services that are super cheap and fun to play with. We'll do more.

## Week 6 • Sensors & Physical Prototypes

Wednesday, March 7, 2018

Not everything you can prototype is on a screen. We can make real-life, physical objects, too. And playing with these things can help you learn to code, break away fears of technology and have fun.

## Week 7 • Data and Personal Security + Project Discussions 

Wednesday, March 14, 2018

We'll have a discussion about locking down your devices and your projects to protect yourself and your sources.

## Week 8 • Paper Prototyping / Brainstorming

Wednesday, March 21, 2018

Now that you've played with some examples and understand some building blocks, we'll start experimenting based on your projects -- with rapid, low-risk prototypes.

## Week 9 • Proposal Presentations & Feedback

Wednesday, March 28, 2018

Everyone will present on their project progress, and we'll critique each other and revise as a group.

With an audience!

Using slides, your prototypes and your end product, no matter what its state, you will describe:

* All of your prototyping stages
* The feedback you got at each point
* What worked
* What didn't work, and changes you made
* The current state of the product
* Your next steps
