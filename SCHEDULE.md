# Class Schedule

## Week 1 • Wednesday, January 31, 2018

**SMS Texting / Introduction / Prototyping**

We'll get to know each other, talk about what we're bringing to the class and play with some texting projects.

[-> Plans and notes](week01)

## Week 2 • Wednesday, February 7, 2018

**Bots & Intelligent Agents**

Alexa, Siri and many other agents are now a part of our world. Let's play with some bots, build some bots, and think about how they could be used in your projects.

## Week 3 • Wednesday, February 14, 2018

Last day to drop this course is this coming Friday. 

**APIs**

I like to call API's "Another Person's Information" -- services out there you can use to build a unique offering of your own. We'll get our hands into some of this data and how we can play with it -- in our bots and on free online services.

## Week 4 • Wednesday, February 21, 2018

**Making your own API**

What if there's not an API out there that does _exactly_ what you want? You can make your own. This also happens to be how you can do calculations while you're computer -- and you -- are asleep. We'll get up and running with building things in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) "cloud."

## Week 5 • Wednesday, February 28, 2018

**Cloud Computing Continued**

There's a lot more we can do super cheaply with Amazon's services that are super cheap and fun to play with. We'll do more.

## Week 6 • Wednesday, March 7, 2018

**Sensors & Physical Prototypes**

Not everything you can prototype is on a screen. We can make real-life, physical objects, too. And playing with these things can help you learn to code, break away fears of technology and have fun.


## Week 7 • Wednesday, March 14, 2018

**Data and Personal Security & Project Discussions**

We'll have a discussion about locking down your devices and your projects to protect yourself and your sources.


## Week 8 • Wednesday, March 21, 2018

**Paper Prototyping / Presentations / Cardboard Prototyping**

Now that you've played with some examples and understand some building blocks, we'll start experimenting based on your projects -- with rapid, low-risk prototypes.

## Week 9 • Wednesday, March 28, 2018

**Proposal Presentations & Feedback**

Everyone will present on their project progress, and we'll critique each other and revise as a group.

**Final Presentations and Demonstrations**

With an audience!

Using slides, your prototypes and your end product, no matter what its state, you will describe:

* Your audience and initial goal
* All of your prototyping stages
* The feedback you got at each point
* What worked
* What didn't work, and changes you made
* The current state of the product
* Your next steps
