# Class Schedule

## Week 1 • Monday, January 30, 2017	

**SMS Texting / Introduction / Prototyping**

We'll get to know each other, talk about what we're bringing to the class and play with some texting projects.

[-> Plans and notes](week01)

_Assignent due next week:_
* List 10 ways you might use SMS in your project, with a descriptive paragraph for each. Alter the POV if you need to.
* Storyboard one of them on sheets of paper or post-its, simulating the text experience. Bring the sheets to class.
* Read [Bootcamp Bootleg](http://bit.ly/d-thinking-bootleg) :
	* PDF pages 1-8 (through Mode:Test)
	* PDF page 36 (Prototype for Empathy) to page 43 (Feedback Capture Grid)
	* As much of the rest as you'd like. It's all good.

## Week 2 • Monday, February 6, 2017

**Bots & Intellegent Agents**

Alexa, Siri and many other agents are now a part of our world. Let's play with some bots, talk about how to make them and think about how they could be used in your projects.

_Assignent due next week: List 5 possible bots for your project. Pick one. List or storyboard how it would work, including at least 5 different intents, what each intent would do and what other factors you'd need to answer the intended question or command._

## Week 3 • Wednesday, February 15, 2017

**No Class**

_Assignent due next week: Sign up for one-on-one week of March 20._

## Week 4 • Monday, February 27, 2017

**APIs & SDKs**

I like to call API's "Another Person's Information" -- services out there you can use to build a unique offering of your own. SDKs are "Software Development Kits" that let you tinker with real-world objects like the iPhone and Amazon Echo. We'll get our hands into some code today.

_Assignent due next week:_
* Find 10 APIs that might be useful to your project. Give me the title, the URL and how you might use it. 
* Install Eagle on your computer from   http://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview

## Week 5 • Monday, March 6, 2017

**Sensors & Hardware Prototypes**

Not everything you can prototype is on a screen. We can make real-life, physical objects, too. And playing with these things can help you learn to code, break away fears of technology and have fun.

_Assignents due next week:_
* Submit you Eagle files (if you haven't done so in class).
* Write two paragraphs describing your prototyping project._

## Week 6 • Monday, March 13, 2017

**Paper Prototyping / Presentations / Cardboard Prototyping**

Now that you've played with some examples and understand some building blocks, we'll start experimenting based on your projects -- with rapid, low-risk prototypes.

_Assignent due next week: Finish your "cardboard" prototype. Test it with at least 15 students outside this class, family and other friends. Write up what you've learned from every person who tested it._

## Week 7 • Monday, March 20, 2017

**Feedback review / Making it real(er)**

We'll talk about the feedback you got, refine your ideas and talk about ways to make your prototypes even more real, with iPhone simulators and the like.

_Assignents due next week:_
* Meet with John one-on-one to plan for the rest of your project. Prepare slide presentation of idea, including the goals, how it will work, and your plan for making it happen. 

* Prepare your progress presentations so we have a sense of where you are, what you've discovered and where you're going.

* Read about soldering (and watch the videos): https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder---through-hole-soldering

## Week 8 • Monday, March 27, 2017

**Progress Presentations / Hardware Redux**

Everyone will present on their project progress, and we'll critique each other and revise as a group. Then we'll play with a little more hardware -- including soldering!

_Assignent due next week: Refine your project and submit your plan. Prepare for your workshop and presentation._

With an audience!

Using slides, your prototypes and your end product, no matter what its state, you will describe:

* Your audience and initial goal
* All of your prototyping stages
* The feedback you got at each point
* What worked
* What didn't work, and changes you made
* The current state of the product
* Your next steps
