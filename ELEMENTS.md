# Elements

Basic components of this class.

## Logistics

### Slack for Communications

Let's strive for a no-email zone. We'll communicate using Slack, like just about every newsroom in the United States.

Slack is also a great platform for experimentation and prototyping.

### Github for Code

I'll post code, examples and and documents here. Get a GitHub account so you can make easy copies.

The GitHub repo is public. 

### Dropbox for Storage

We'll also keep a Dropbox folder for easy access to shared files. I can be convinced to use Google Drive instead.

## Principles

### Design Thinking

### Project-driven Efforts

### Collaboration

### Bring Ideas to Explore
